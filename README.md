CheckDigitCalculator is a simple GUI-based check digit calculator for my mother's customs brokering company KMK CHB. Her software originally did this for her, but support was removed for that feature. Calculating the check digits isn't a particularly difficult process, but it interefered with her workflow so I offered to write this program.

The GUI is created using Java Swing. This project, while very simple, was my first experience in developing a product for a client. I had to keep in mind that she needed a no frills application that fit well into her data entry workflow. To accomodate this, I kept the interface very simple and asked for feedback to fit my product better to her needs. For example, I added functionality to automatically copy the resulting check digits to her clipboard.

Although this application was developed for KMK CHB, it can be used for anyone filing entries for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
