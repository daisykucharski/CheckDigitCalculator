# CheckDigitCalculator

CheckDigitCalculator is a simple check digit calculator for my mother's customs brokering company KMK CHB. Her software originally did this for her, but support was removed for that feature. Calculating the check digits isn't a particularly difficult process, but it interefered with her workflow so I offered to write this program.

I originally created this project using Java Swing (seen in the java-version folder), because that was the technology that I was most comfortable with. However, I discovered that this didn't really fit my client's needs. She's planning on switching computers sometime soon, so I would be unable to assist her in setting up the JRE in order to run the project on the new computer. Thus, I turned the project  to a simple web application.

This project, while very simple, was my first experience in developing a product for a client. I had to keep in mind that she needed a no frills application that fit well into her data entry workflow. To accomodate this, I kept the interface very simple and asked for feedback to fit my product better to her needs. For example, I added functionality to automatically copy the resulting check digits to her clipboard.

Although this application was developed for KMK CHB, it can be used for anyone filing entries for U.S. Customs and Border Protection.
